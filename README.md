# Django for Beginners

Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create a web application in a matter of hours.

This repository contains two different projects: the `mvc-structure-demo` project is a basic project demonstrating the model-view-controller architecture, and the `blog-demo` project is a full blog application.

These demo projects are created for the [Django for Beginners](https://www.ericsdevblog.com/posts/django-for-beginners-1/) tutorial:

- [Django for Beginners #1](https://www.ericsdevblog.com/posts/django-for-beginners-1/)
